# 🔥 Power-Aware VM Placement using Discrete Firefly Algorithm

This Streamlit web app demonstrates an intelligent Virtual Machine (VM) placement strategy using the **Discrete Firefly Algorithm (DFA)** to minimize total power consumption across multiple Physical Machines (PMs) in a cloud infrastructure.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Auto or manual VM/PM configuration**
- ⚙️ **Optimized VM allocation** using Firefly algorithm
- 🔋 **Power-aware modeling** with idle and busy power
- 📈 **Interactive visualization** of PM utilization and power usage
- 📥 **Export-ready** results for further analysis (optional CSV)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) – UI framework
- Python – Core logic and DFA algorithm
- NumPy, Pandas – Data handling
- Matplotlib – Visualization

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. User enters or generates VM and PM data
2. The Discrete Firefly Algorithm iteratively searches for optimal assignments
3. The goal is to **minimize total power consumption**
4. Output includes:
   - VM → PM assignments
   - Power usage per PM
   - Graph of utilization vs. power
